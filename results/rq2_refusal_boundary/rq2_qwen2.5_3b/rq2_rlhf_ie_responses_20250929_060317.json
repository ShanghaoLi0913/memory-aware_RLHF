The current session (Session 3) is dated (2023/02/18 (Sat) 19:31). To calculate the number of months that have passed, we subtract the date of the last museum visit from the current date:\n\n2023/02/18 - 2022/10/22 = 6 months and 2 days\n\nSince we are asked for the number of months, we round down to the nearest whole number:\n\nNumber of months that have passed = 6 months\n\nTherefore, 6 months have passed since you last visited a museum with a friend.

Since the conversation history only mentions signing a contract with your first client and does not provide the date of your website launch, we cannot calculate the number of days between these two events based solely on the given information.\n\nHowever, if you provide the launch date of your website and the date you signed the contract, I can help you calculate the difference.
