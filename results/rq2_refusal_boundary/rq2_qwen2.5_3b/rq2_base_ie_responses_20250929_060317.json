At the Lake Charles Refinery, some of the main refining processes that take place include atmospheric distillation, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), alkylation, and hydrotreating. Atmospheric distillation is the first step in the refining process, where crude oil is heated and separated into different fractions based on their boiling points. Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) is used to break down heavier fractions of crude oil into lighter, more valuable products such as gasoline and diesel fuel. Alkylation is a process that combines smaller molecules to form larger ones, creating high-octane gasoline components. Hydrotreating is used to remove impurities from the gasoline and diesel fractions to improve their quality.",
