    "response": "Based on the conversation history provided, you completed fixing the fence first. The user mentioned, \"By the way, I just fixed that broken fence on the east side of my property three weeks ago, where my goats like to graze, and it's been a huge relief to have them safe and secure.\" This statement indicates that the fence fix occurred three weeks prior to discussing the purchase of cows from Peter.
